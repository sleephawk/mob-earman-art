          Snoozecrow is an ambient musician (who also happens to be a crow) with
          a strange collaborator; a small, relatively friendly, sheet ghost.
          Appearing from his first days hatched and proceeding to haunt him
          throughout his 30 years on earth, the ghost makes snoozy's life a
          balancing act, but one adapts. The music helped.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>Mob Earman is a bird of unknown species; by his own
          unscientific diagnosis he is a 'wheatear magpie'. He is also a
          musician (though his genre is as elusive as his origins) but primarily
          a painter of the spirits he claims to have discovered and therefore
          named after himself - the earmen. Whilst using them as a muse, he
          presumed no one else could see or experience them. This is until the
          day he met a crow known as Snoozy and his companion, a small friendly
          sheet ghost...

          This is the story of{" "}
          <strong>Snoozy, Mob and the Other Realms.</strong> It is a story about
          the magic of music, the maddening power of the unknown, and of all
          things, the balancing of those two warring states of being:
          tranquility and chaos.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          It is <em>also</em> a story I don't want to tell with one medium. Yes
          yes, you'll get your words, but I want to show you{" "}
          <strong>
            the songs, the summonings, the world in 3d video game form, the
            magic as it happened for them
          </strong>
          . You will see this tale from multiple angles, and every follow, sale
          and share will support its creation. If you like the sound of that,
          you're in the right place.
